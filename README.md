# Data_Structures_using_Python
This repository aims to contribute efficient solutions with easy to follow instructions for the data structure LeetCode problems in Python.

* Every week, solutions to different LeetCode problems will be added.
* The solutions will be multiple starting from Brute Force Aprroach towards the most Efficient Approach.
* These Approaches will be coded and will contain comments for easy to read the code.
* Moreover, to furthere enhance the understanding of the problem at hand, details about the problem, time and computational complexity and algorithms will be provided as well.
* Feel free to contact me to further improve upon the solution and possibly point out bugs if there are any.
* Above all, let's have FUN learning while focusing on tackling the problem in an easy and efficient manner
